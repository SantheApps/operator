# Building an Autonomous AI Agent: The Vision & Architecture (Part 1/5)

Most AI projects today are chatbots. You type, they type back. But what if your AI could *act* on your behalf? What if it could plan a project, check your code, deploy your app, and even fix itself when things break—all while you sleep?

This is the promise of **Autonomous Agents**. Unlike chatbots, agents have:
1.  **Goals** (long-term objectives)
2.  **Memory** (persistence across sessions)
3.  **Skills** (integrations with real-world tools)
4.  **Autonomy** (looping execution without constant prompts)
5.  **Extensibility** (plugins, hooks, and commands to grow capabilities)

In this 7-part series, we will break down exactly how we built `@praveencs/agent`, a powerful, open-source autonomous agent runtime.

## 🏗️ The Core Architecture

To build a truly functional agent, we need several distinct components working in harmony. We'll use a modular architecture:

### 1. The Brain (Planner)
Standard LLMs (like GPT-4) are great at answering questions but terrible at long-term execution. To fix this, we need a **Planner**.
- **Role**: Take a high-level goal ("Build a blog") and decompose it into small, atomic tasks ("Create Next.js app", "Set up DB", "Write About page").
- **Innovation**: We use a recursive decomposition strategy where the LLM acts as a project manager.

### 2. The Body (Executor)
Once we have a list of tasks, something needs to *do* them. This is the **Executor**.
- **Role**: Pick up the next task, determine the right tool (Skill) to use, and execute it.
- **Innovation**: We treat shell commands as first-class citizens. The agent can run `npm install`, `git commit`, or `docker build` just like a human developer.

### 3. The Memory (Context)
A developer who forgets the codebase every morning is useless. Our agent needs **Memory**.
- **Role**: Store project context ("This is a TypeScript project"), facts ("Staging IP is 10.0.0.5"), and learnings ("The last build failed because of a missing dependency").
- **Innovation**: We use SQLite with FTS5 (Full-Text Search) and a JSON-based vector-like storage to quickly retrieve relevant context for every task.

### 4. The Daemon (Autonomy)
The secret sauce is the loop. A chatbot waits for input. An agent runs in a loop.
- **Role**: A background process that constantly checks for pending tasks, file changes, or new goals.

### 5. The Nervous System (Hooks & Plugins)
As of **v0.8.0**, our agent has a full extensibility layer:
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Intercept execution at any point (`before:tool`, `after:plan`, etc.).
- **Lightweight Commands**: Markdown-based goal templates—no code needed.
- **Plugin System**: Install community bundles that add skills, commands, and hooks.
- **Multi-CLI Tools**: Delegate tasks to Cursor, Codex, Gemini, or Claude CLIs.

### 6. The Voice (Interactive CLI)
The agent now has a **conversational interface**. Type `agent` with no arguments to enter an interactive REPL with slash commands, tab completion, and multi-turn context.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We're building this in **TypeScript** (Node.js) because:
- **Ecosystem**: Access to millions of npm packages.
- **Safety**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors in complex logic flows.
- **Performance**: Validated through years of enterprise usage.

**Key Libraries:**
- `better-sqlite3`: Fast, synchronous SQLite access.
- `commander`: Powerful CLI framework.
- `openai/anthropic-sdk`: Interface to the LLM brains.

## 🚀 What's Next?

In **Part 2**, we will dive into the code for **The Brain**. We'll write the `GoalDecomposer` class that turns vague requests into structured project plans.
